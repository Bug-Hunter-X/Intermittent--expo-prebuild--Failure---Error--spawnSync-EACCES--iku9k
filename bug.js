While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the `expo prebuild` command failed with the error message: `Error: spawnSync EACCES`. This occurred despite having appropriate permissions for the project directory and its contents. I tried various troubleshooting steps including updating Node.js, npm, and Expo CLI, but the problem persisted.  The error seemed intermittent, sometimes succeeding and other times failing for the same command.
